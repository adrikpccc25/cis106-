# Lecture 8 Notes

## awk
* Awk is a scripting language used for processing and displaying text.

### Usage:
* awk + options + {awk command} + file + file to save (optional)


### Examples: 
* Print the first column of every line of a file
  * awk '{print $1}' ~/Documents/Csv/cars.csv
* Print first field of /etc/passwd file
  * awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
* Print first field of /etc/passwd file
  * awk -F: '{print $NF}' /etc/passwd

## sed
* SED is a stream editor that perform operations on files and standard output. You can edit files without opening them

### Usage:
* sed options + sed script + file


### Examples:
* Replacing a string in given file (replace pizza for rice)
  * sed 's/pizza/rice' shopping-list.lst
* Replacing only the fourth occurrence per line in a file
  * sed 's/pizza/rice/4' shopping-list.lst
* Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern of a file
  * sed 's/pizza/rice/g' shopping-list.lst


## less
* a pager program used for reading files 1 page at a time.


### Usage:
* pager program + file to read


### Examples:
* less ~/Documents/Books/dracula.txt

## >
* Append means to add more to a file instead of overwriting its content. When we use > on a file that already exist and contains data, we overwrite whatever is already inside the file.

### Usage:
* Command output + > + file


### Examples:
* Save the output of a command to a file
  * ls -lA ~ > all-files-in-home.txt
* save the error generated by a command to a file
  * ls -lA downloads/ 2> error-of-ls
* save the error to a file and the success to another
  * ls -lA downloads/ Pictures > success.txt 2> error.txt

## >>
* If you want to keep the old data, then you use >>.

### Usage:
* Command output + >> + file

### Examples:
* ls -la >> allmyfiles.lst

## |
* The pipe allows you to redirect the standard output of a command to the standard input of another.

### Usage:
* command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N


### Examples:
* use grep to look for a string in a particular man page
  * man ls | grep "human-readable"
* Display only the options of the of any command from its man page
  * man ls | grep "^[[space]]*[[punct:]]"
* Display only the 2nd line in a file
  * head -2 file.lst | tail -1
